		Clipping : when a amplitude of a waveform exceeds the max/min sample size 2^15 or 32767
		Clipping appears when the waveforms has changes shape suddenly and does not follow it's 
		normal contour
		
		Normalization:
		finding the maximum amplitude of a waveform, identifying that maximum in comparison with largest
		possible amplitude, and creating a multiplier value by maxPossibleAmpl/maxAmpOfWave. Then
		multiplying all other wave amplitudes by that value
		
		Amplitude:
		The distance from zero to greatest pressure (or least pressure) of a waveform is 
		amplitude
		
		Rarefactions:
		Decreases in airpressues for a waveform, as opposed to the increases in pressure are
		called compressions
		
		WAV:
		is a standard encoding for sound
		
		Iterate:
		Step through each consecutive value in a loop
		
		for-each loop:
		for (String item : someList)
		sequential step loop through all the items in a list. 
		
		Sine Wave: 
		The simplest form of a sound wave. In a sine wave the compressions and rarefactions 
		arrive with equal size and regularity.
